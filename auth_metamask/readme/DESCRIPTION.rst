With this module you can login to Odoo with Metamask. A method that offers you the following advantages:

* **Increased security**: Proof of ownership by public-key encryption is arguably more secure than proof of ownership by email/password or by a third partyâ€”all the more so because MetaMask stores credentials locally on your computer, and not on online servers, which makes the attack surface smaller
* **Simplified UX**: This is a one-click (okay, maybe two-click) login flow, done in a handful of seconds, without the need to type or remember any password
* **Increased privacy**: No email needed, and no third party involved.

This module is based on work of AMAURY MARTINY. See details `here <https://www.toptal.com/ethereum/one-click-login-flows-a-metamask-tutorial>`_
