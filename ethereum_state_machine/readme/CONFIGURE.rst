Go to `Ethereum State Machine -> Settings -> Contracts`

A) Download `this <https://github.com/flachica/ethereum-testing/blob/main/contracts/EthereumStateMachine.sol>`_ and fill `Smart contract source code` field with this file
B) Change state of contract to `Running` state

Go to records of `Referenced Model`. The system auto publish a Smart Contract with this machine state inside


If you need to add a logic of different states, you can add them without having to modify the source code of the smart contract. But make sure the transitions between states are consistent
